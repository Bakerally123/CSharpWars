## Part 1 - Forming the Idea

### Context

I have been working as a software development consultant and C# and .NET teacher for the past years. Sometimes developers and students can use some extra fun to awaken their creativity and improve their enthousiasm. In order to make students have some fun while learning and make developers creative while being competitive, I wanted to create a game that can be scripted using C#.

### Game?

The easiest idea for a game that can be scripted using .NET and C# is a deathmatch game where players fight a match inside an arena. Each player can script one, or even multiple robots inside the arena. Once a robot has been scripted and deployed into the arena, its future is entirely dependent of the script. It cannot be changed, and it cannot be revoked.

### Technology?

Because I am a developer myself and I obviously wanted to have some fun, I took this opportunity to dive into some new technologies. At the core of the game itself, because it should be possible to script robots using C#, I looked at the **Microsoft Compiler Platform (Roslyn)**. As a total newbie I wanted to challenge myself and use the **Unity Game Engine** to create a good looking 3D client application to display the arena with fighting robots. For communication between frontent, middleware and backend I chose to use **ASP.NET Core WebApi** and **Microsoft SQL Server** for storing simple relational data.
